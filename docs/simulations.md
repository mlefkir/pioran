# Simulating time series

In the following, we will simulate time series with different methods. We first describe the theory behind the methods and then show how to use them in the package.



## Timmer and Koenig's method

We follow the method described in [Timmer & Koenig (1995)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995A%26A...300..707T) 

## Autocovariance method
