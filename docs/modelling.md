# Modelling

In this package, we can model the underlying stochastic process which might generate the time series using either a model for the autocovariance function or the power spectral density function.

## Modelling with an autocovariance

The autocovariance function is represented in the object {class}`pioran.acvf.CovarianceFunction`


## Modelling with a power spectral density
